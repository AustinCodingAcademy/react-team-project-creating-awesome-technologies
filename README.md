I added a calendar package for our project. 
The link for the package is [http://intljusticemission.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html#intro](url)

Use command `npm i --save react-big-calendar` to add calendar
Also need to add moment as dependency `npm i --save moment`

I also changed our backend address to be [https://spring-app-my-team.herokuapp.com/](url)
